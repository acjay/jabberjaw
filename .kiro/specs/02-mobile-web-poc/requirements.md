# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines a mobile web application proof-of-concept for Jabberjaw. The goal is to quickly validate the core product concept using web technologies before investing in native mobile development. This POC will demonstrate the end-to-end user experience: location tracking, backend integration, and audio playback in a mobile browser.

The mobile web POC will serve as a rapid prototype to test user interaction patterns, content quality, and technical feasibility. It will use web APIs for location tracking and online text-to-speech services for audio generation, providing a complete functional demonstration of the Jabberjaw concept.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a potential user, I want to test Jabberjaw functionality in my mobile browser, so that I can experience the core concept without installing a native app.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I visit the web app on my mobile device THEN the system SHALL display a responsive interface optimized for mobile screens
2. WHEN I grant location permissions THEN the system SHALL use the browser's Geolocation API to track my position
3. WHEN my location changes significantly THEN the system SHALL automatically request new content from the backend service
4. WHEN new content is received THEN the system SHALL automatically begin audio playback using web-based text-to-speech
5. WHEN the web app is running THEN it SHALL work across major mobile browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user testing the POC, I want simple web-based controls and intelligent content triggering, so that I can interact with the core functionality without hearing repetitive content about my starting location.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I load the web app THEN the system SHALL display clear start and stop buttons with mobile-friendly touch targets
2. WHEN I press start for the first time THEN the system SHALL request location permissions, begin tracking, and play "Welcome to Jabberjaw! Once your trip begins, I'll start telling you about the places you pass by"
3. WHEN I press start on subsequent launches THEN the system SHALL begin location tracking silently without immediate content generation
4. WHEN I press start THEN the system SHALL NOT generate location-based content until my location changes by more than 100 feet from the starting point
5. WHEN my location changes by more than 100 feet THEN the system SHALL begin generating and playing content about my new location
6. WHEN I press stop THEN the system SHALL cease location tracking and audio playback
7. WHEN content is playing THEN the system SHALL provide pause, resume, and skip controls
8. WHEN I interact with controls THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback
9. WHEN the browser tab is backgrounded THEN audio playback SHALL continue if the browser supports it

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a web user, I want the POC to use online text-to-speech services for consistent audio quality, so that I can properly evaluate the content experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN content is received from the backend THEN the system SHALL use an online text-to-speech service to generate audio
2. WHEN TTS audio is generated THEN the system SHALL play it through the browser's audio capabilities
3. WHEN selecting TTS services THEN the system SHALL prioritize services with good mobile browser support
4. WHEN the TTS service fails THEN the system SHALL display the text content as a fallback
5. WHEN audio is playing THEN the system SHALL provide volume controls and playback status
6. WHEN using different devices THEN the TTS voice SHALL be consistent across all browsers and devices

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the web POC to be built with modern web technologies, so that it can be developed quickly and demonstrate technical feasibility.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the web app THEN it SHALL use modern JavaScript/TypeScript and responsive CSS
2. WHEN building the interface THEN it SHALL use Deno Fresh and Tailwind
3. WHEN handling location data THEN it SHALL use the browser's native Geolocation API
4. WHEN making backend requests THEN it SHALL use the Fetch API with proper error handling
5. WHEN deploying THEN it SHALL be hostable on static web hosting platforms for easy sharing and testing

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a stakeholder, I want the web POC to demonstrate the complete user journey, so that I can evaluate the product concept and user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the POC THEN it SHALL demonstrate the complete flow from location detection to audio playback
2. WHEN content is generated THEN it SHALL show the same quality and variety as the planned native app
3. WHEN testing different locations THEN the POC SHALL generate contextually relevant content
4. WHEN evaluating the experience THEN the POC SHALL provide insights into user interaction patterns and content effectiveness
5. WHEN sharing with stakeholders THEN the POC SHALL be easily accessible via a web URL without installation requirements

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user testing on mobile, I want the web app to handle mobile-specific challenges gracefully, so that I can properly evaluate the concept on my device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using mobile browsers THEN the system SHALL handle touch interactions and mobile viewport constraints
2. WHEN the device orientation changes THEN the interface SHALL adapt appropriately
3. WHEN mobile data connectivity is poor THEN the system SHALL provide feedback about connection status
4. WHEN the browser enforces autoplay restrictions THEN the system SHALL handle audio playback policies gracefully
5. WHEN the device goes to sleep THEN the system SHALL handle wake lock APIs if available to maintain functionality
6. WHEN testing on different mobile devices THEN the experience SHALL be consistent across iOS and Android browsers
