# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Jabberjaw is a location-aware mobile application that generates and delivers podcast-style narration about points of interest during road trips. The app uses GPS location data to identify nearby landmarks, towns, and other notable features, then leverages cloud-hosted LLMs to create engaging 3-minute audio segments that are delivered via text-to-speech. The system is designed to provide continuous, automated storytelling that transforms mundane highway driving into an educational and entertaining experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a road trip driver, I want the app to automatically detect my location and generate narration about nearby points of interest, so that I can learn about places I'm passing without having to research them myself.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user starts the app THEN the system SHALL request location permissions and begin GPS tracking
2. WHEN the user's location changes significantly THEN the system SHALL identify points of interest within a configurable radius, which could include types like town, county, neighborhood, major road, landmark, institution, waterway, named bridge, mountain, park, and so forth.
3. WHEN categorized points of interest are available THEN the system SHALL generate narrative content using a cloud-hosted LLM

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a road trip passenger, I want to hear engaging 3-minute audio segments about the places we're passing, so that I can stay entertained and learn interesting facts during the journey.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN narrative content is generated THEN the system SHALL convert it to speech using text-to-speech technology
2. WHEN audio content is ready THEN the system SHALL play it automatically through the device speakers
3. WHEN an audio segment begins THEN it SHALL last approximately 3 minutes
4. WHEN an audio segment completes THEN the system SHALL automatically generate and play the next segment based on current location
5. WHEN generating content THEN the system SHALL include variety such as fun facts, related persons, name origins, founding stories, and major events

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to control when the narration starts and stops, so that I can use the app only when I want to hear about my surroundings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the app THEN the system SHALL display start and stop controls
2. WHEN the user presses start THEN the system SHALL begin location tracking and content generation
3. WHEN the user presses stop THEN the system SHALL cease all narration and location processing
4. WHEN narration is active THEN the user SHALL be able to pause and resume playback
5. WHEN narration is active THEN the system SHALL enable a skip control that will cause the system to pick a new location-driven subject, generate content, and then begin playback
6. WHEN the app is backgrounded THEN narration SHALL continue playing

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to have a modular backend architecture, so that I can easily test and maintain different components of the content generation pipeline.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the backend THEN the system SHALL include a content generation service that takes point of interest descriptions and produces narrative text
2. WHEN implementing the backend THEN the system SHALL include an orchestration service that coordinates location processing, POI identification, and content generation
3. WHEN deploying services THEN they SHALL coexist in a single deployable unit using NestJS
4. WHEN organizing code THEN the system SHALL use a monorepo structure containing both mobile apps and backend services
5. WHEN implementing backend services THEN they SHALL be written in TypeScript

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an Android user, I want to use this app on my Android device, so that I can access the road trip narration functionality on my preferred mobile platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developing the mobile app THEN it SHALL target the Android platform initially
2. WHEN the app runs on Android THEN it SHALL integrate with Android's location services
3. WHEN the app runs on Android THEN it SHALL use Android's text-to-speech capabilities
4. WHEN the app runs on Android THEN it SHALL handle background processing appropriately for the platform

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the content generation to be reliable and scalable, so that multiple users can receive quality narration simultaneously.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating content THEN the system SHALL use cloud-hosted LLM services for scalability
2. WHEN the LLM service is unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate error handling and user feedback
3. WHEN processing location data THEN the system SHALL handle network connectivity issues gracefully
4. WHEN multiple requests are made THEN the backend SHALL handle concurrent content generation requests
5. WHEN content is generated THEN it SHALL be contextually relevant to the specific geographic location

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to work during my road trip without requiring constant internet connectivity, so that I can use it in areas with poor cell coverage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN internet connectivity is lost THEN the system SHALL continue playing previously generated content
2. WHEN connectivity is restored THEN the system SHALL resume generating new content based on current location
3. WHEN in offline mode THEN the system SHALL provide user feedback about connectivity status
4. WHEN location data is available offline THEN the system SHALL cache it for use when connectivity returns

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a road trip enthusiast, I want the app to recognize and prioritize historically significant roads and routes, so that I can learn about important transportation corridors and their cultural impact beyond just standard highway information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN identifying roads and highways THEN the system SHALL check for historical significance beyond standard highway classification
2. WHEN a road has substantial historical documentation THEN the system SHALL elevate its importance in POI discovery results
3. WHEN determining historical significance THEN the system SHALL use Wikipedia article length as a primary heuristic, with articles over 1000 words indicating significance
4. WHEN processing historically significant roads THEN the system SHALL include historical context and cultural importance in generated content
5. WHEN generating content about significant roads THEN the system SHALL prioritize historical narratives over standard geographic information
6. WHEN caching road significance data THEN the system SHALL avoid repeated API calls for previously assessed roads
