# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the minimum viable product for the Jabberjaw Android mobile application. The goal is to create a functional Android app that can track user location, communicate with the backend service, and provide audio playback of generated travel content.

The Android MVP will provide the core user experience: automatic location tracking, content retrieval from the backend, and audio playback with basic user controls. This represents the minimum functionality needed to validate the core product concept with real users.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a road trip traveler, I want an Android app that automatically tracks my location and plays travel content, so that I can learn about places I'm passing without manual interaction.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I open the app THEN the system SHALL request location permissions and display the current permission status
2. WHEN location permissions are granted THEN the system SHALL begin GPS tracking and display my current location
3. WHEN my location changes significantly THEN the system SHALL automatically request new content from the backend service
4. WHEN new content is received THEN the system SHALL automatically begin audio playback
5. WHEN content is playing THEN the system SHALL display the current segment information and playback status

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want simple controls and intelligent content triggering, so that I can control when and what I listen to without hearing repetitive content about my starting location.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I open the app THEN the system SHALL display clear start and stop buttons
2. WHEN I press start for the first time THEN the system SHALL begin location tracking and play "Welcome to Jabberjaw! Once your trip begins, I'll start telling you about the places you pass by"
3. WHEN I press start on subsequent launches THEN the system SHALL begin location tracking silently without immediate content generation
4. WHEN I press start THEN the system SHALL NOT generate location-based content until my location changes by more than 100 feet from the starting point
5. WHEN my location changes by more than 100 feet THEN the system SHALL begin generating and playing content about my new location
6. WHEN I press stop THEN the system SHALL cease all location tracking and audio playback
7. WHEN content is playing THEN the system SHALL provide pause and resume controls
8. WHEN content is playing THEN the system SHALL provide a skip button that requests new content for the current location
9. WHEN I minimize the app THEN audio playback SHALL continue in the background

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want the app to handle network connectivity issues gracefully, so that I can still use the app in areas with poor cell coverage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app loses internet connectivity THEN it SHALL display the current connection status to the user
2. WHEN connectivity is lost during playback THEN the current audio segment SHALL continue playing to completion
3. WHEN connectivity is restored THEN the app SHALL resume requesting new content based on current location
4. WHEN the backend service is unavailable THEN the app SHALL display appropriate error messages and retry automatically
5. WHEN network requests fail THEN the app SHALL implement exponential backoff retry logic

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an Android user, I want the app to use Android's built-in text-to-speech and integrate properly with the audio system, so that it works consistently across devices and with other apps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN content is received from the backend THEN the system SHALL use Android's built-in TextToSpeech API to convert text to audio
2. WHEN audio is playing THEN the system SHALL properly manage Android audio focus
3. WHEN I receive a phone call THEN the app SHALL pause audio playback and resume after the call ends
4. WHEN other apps request audio focus THEN the app SHALL pause playback appropriately
5. WHEN the app is in the background THEN it SHALL display a notification with playback controls
6. WHEN using Bluetooth or wired headphones THEN audio SHALL route correctly to the selected output device
7. WHEN Android TTS is not available or fails THEN the app SHALL provide appropriate error handling and user feedback

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a battery-conscious user, I want the app to optimize power usage during extended trips, so that it doesn't drain my phone battery excessively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tracking location THEN the system SHALL use efficient location update intervals to balance accuracy with battery usage
2. WHEN the app is in the background THEN it SHALL minimize CPU usage while maintaining core functionality
3. WHEN the device is low on battery THEN the system SHALL provide options to reduce location tracking frequency
4. WHEN location hasn't changed significantly THEN the system SHALL avoid unnecessary backend requests
5. WHEN the app is stopped THEN all background processing SHALL cease to preserve battery

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Android app to be built with modern Android development practices, so that it's maintainable and follows platform conventions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the app THEN it SHALL use Kotlin as the primary programming language
2. WHEN building the UI THEN it SHALL follow Material Design guidelines and Android UI patterns
3. WHEN managing app lifecycle THEN it SHALL properly handle Android activity and service lifecycles
4. WHEN storing data locally THEN it SHALL use appropriate Android storage mechanisms
5. WHEN implementing background tasks THEN it SHALL use Android's recommended background processing patterns

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want the Android app to have proper error handling and logging, so that issues can be diagnosed and resolved quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN the app SHALL log appropriate information for debugging without exposing sensitive data
2. WHEN the app crashes THEN it SHALL attempt to recover gracefully and maintain user data
3. WHEN network errors occur THEN the app SHALL provide clear user feedback about the issue and potential solutions
4. WHEN location services fail THEN the app SHALL guide the user through troubleshooting steps
5. WHEN the app encounters unexpected states THEN it SHALL fail safely without losing user progress
