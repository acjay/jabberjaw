# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Walking Mode feature transforms Jabberjaw from a highway-focused travel companion into a pedestrian-friendly local exploration tool. This mode recognizes that the walking experience requires a fundamentally different approach to point of interest discovery and story generation, focusing on hyperlocal details, pedestrian-accessible locations, and the intimate scale of neighborhood exploration rather than broad geographic landmarks.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a pedestrian explorer, I want to activate walking mode so that the app focuses on local, walkable points of interest rather than highway-scale landmarks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects walking mode THEN the system SHALL switch to pedestrian-focused POI discovery algorithms
2. WHEN walking mode is active THEN the system SHALL use a reduced search radius of 50-200 meters instead of highway-scale distances
3. WHEN walking mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL prioritize pedestrian-accessible locations over vehicle-accessible ones
4. IF walking mode is selected THEN the system SHALL filter out highway-specific POIs like rest stops and gas stations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a walker exploring a neighborhood, I want to discover hyperlocal points of interest so that I can learn about the immediate area around me.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN in walking mode THEN the system SHALL identify local businesses, cafes, shops, and restaurants within walking distance
2. WHEN processing walking locations THEN the system SHALL discover historical markers, street art, architectural details, and neighborhood landmarks
3. WHEN generating walking content THEN the system SHALL include pedestrian-specific features like parks, plazas, walkways, and public spaces
4. IF multiple hyperlocal POIs exist THEN the system SHALL prioritize those with cultural, historical, or architectural significance
5. WHEN identifying POIs THEN the system SHALL include community spaces like libraries, community centers, and local gathering places

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a pedestrian user, I want content that reflects the walking experience so that the narration matches my pace and perspective.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating walking mode content THEN the system SHALL create narratives focused on street-level details and observations
2. WHEN in walking mode THEN the system SHALL generate content about architectural details, storefront histories, and neighborhood character
3. WHEN creating walking content THEN the system SHALL include information about local culture, community stories, and pedestrian experiences
4. IF generating walking narration THEN the system SHALL use a more intimate, observational tone compared to highway content
5. WHEN walking mode is active THEN the system SHALL create shorter story segments suitable for slower travel speeds

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a mobile app user, I want to easily switch between driving and walking modes so that I can use the app for different types of exploration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the app THEN the system SHALL provide a clear toggle between driving mode and walking mode
2. WHEN switching modes THEN the system SHALL immediately adjust POI discovery parameters and story generation style
3. WHEN mode is changed THEN the system SHALL retain location context but re-process POIs according to the new mode
4. IF switching from driving to walking mode THEN the system SHALL clear highway-specific cached stories and regenerate appropriate stories
5. WHEN in walking mode THEN the system SHALL display mode status clearly in the user interface

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a walking user, I want the app to understand pedestrian movement patterns so that it provides relevant content at appropriate times.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN in walking mode THEN the system SHALL use pedestrian-appropriate location update frequencies
2. WHEN detecting walking movement THEN the system SHALL account for slower speeds and more frequent direction changes
3. WHEN processing walking locations THEN the system SHALL consider pedestrian pathways and sidewalk accessibility
4. IF user is walking THEN the system SHALL provide content that matches typical walking speeds and attention patterns
5. WHEN in walking mode THEN the system SHALL optimize for battery efficiency during longer pedestrian sessions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want walking mode to integrate seamlessly with existing systems so that it extends current functionality without breaking existing features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing walking mode THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with existing story generation and caching systems
2. WHEN walking mode is active THEN the system SHALL use the same LLM services but with walking-specific prompts and parameters
3. WHEN processing walking requests THEN the system SHALL extend existing POI discovery services with pedestrian-focused algorithms
4. IF walking mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL maintain the same API structure while adjusting internal processing logic
5. WHEN switching modes THEN the system SHALL preserve user preferences and session state across mode changes
