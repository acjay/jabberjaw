# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification serves as a catch-all for enhancement work beyond the basic MVP functionality. It includes features like persistent content storage, enhanced POI selection processes, historical road significance detection, advanced content generation features, and other improvements that will enhance the user experience and system capabilities.

This spec will likely be broken up into smaller, more focused specs as the features mature and we better understand the implementation priorities. For now, it captures the various enhancement ideas and requirements that go beyond the core MVP functionality.

2. WHEN audio is generated THEN the system SHALL store audio files with appropriate URLs for mobile app access
3. WHEN selecting voices THEN the system SHALL provide configuration options for voice selection, speaking rate, and audio quality
4. WHEN managing audio content THEN the system SHALL implement caching and cleanup policies for audio files
5. WHEN cloud TTS services are unavailable THEN the system SHALL fall back to self-hosted TTS solutions
6. WHEN both cloud and self-hosted TTS fail THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade to text-only content delivery
7. WHEN using cloud or self-hosted TTS THEN the system SHALL ensure consistent voice quality and characteristics across all user devices

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want enhanced POI discovery methods that provide more accurate and relevant location-based content, so that users receive better travel information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN identifying highways THEN the system SHALL use multiple detection methods including point-to-line distance calculations and Google Roads API integration
2. WHEN processing location data THEN the system SHALL implement enhanced Overpass queries with progressive radius search
3. WHEN comparing detection methods THEN the system SHALL provide comparison APIs to evaluate accuracy and performance
4. WHEN POIs are discovered THEN the system SHALL rank them by relevance, proximity, and historical significance
5. WHEN location context changes THEN the system SHALL adapt POI discovery strategies based on geographic region and road types

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to support offline functionality and content prefetching, so that I can continue receiving content even in areas with poor connectivity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN traveling on predicted routes THEN the system SHALL prefetch content for upcoming locations
2. WHEN connectivity is lost THEN the system SHALL continue operating with cached content and location data
3. WHEN offline THEN the system SHALL queue location updates and content requests for when connectivity returns
4. WHEN storage is limited THEN the system SHALL implement intelligent caching policies to manage local content storage
5. WHEN connectivity is restored THEN the system SHALL synchronize queued data and resume normal operation

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a product manager, I want comprehensive user analytics and feedback systems, so that I can understand how the product is being used and identify areas for improvement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users interact with content THEN the system SHALL track engagement metrics like completion rates and skip frequency
2. WHEN content is generated THEN the system SHALL log generation success rates and quality metrics
3. WHEN users provide feedback THEN the system SHALL store ratings and comments associated with specific content or locations
4. WHEN analyzing usage patterns THEN the system SHALL provide insights into popular routes, content types, and user preferences
5. WHEN privacy is a concern THEN all analytics SHALL be anonymized and comply with privacy regulations
6. WHEN users interact with the web POC THEN the system SHALL track basic engagement metrics like session duration and content completion rates
7. WHEN content is played in any interface THEN the system SHALL log which types of content are most engaging
8. WHEN users skip content THEN the system SHALL track skip patterns to identify content quality issues
9. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log error types and frequencies for debugging across all platforms
10. WHEN analyzing usage data THEN the system SHALL provide insights to inform development priorities for both web and native applications
