# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the minimum viable product for the Jabberjaw backend service. The goal is to create a first cut at what is required from the backend service to support location-based content generation. This is not a true MVP as we will certainly discover required changes once we start building the mobile application, but it represents a solid foundation for the core backend functionality.

The backend service will provide RESTful APIs for location processing, point-of-interest identification, and AI-generated travel content using a two-phase story generation approach. The system will first generate story seeds (titles and summaries) for a location, then expand selected stories into full narrative content on demand. Once the orchestration service is complete and functional, this phase will be considered done.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a mobile app developer, I want a backend API that can process location data and return story-based travel content, so that I can build a location-aware mobile application with multiple story options per location.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a location (latitude/longitude) is sent to the backend THEN the system SHALL identify relevant points of interest within a configurable radius
2. WHEN points of interest are identified THEN the system SHALL generate multiple story seeds with titles and summaries using an LLM service
3. WHEN story seeds are generated THEN the system SHALL return them in a structured format suitable for mobile consumption with unique story IDs
4. WHEN the same location is requested multiple times THEN the system SHALL cache and reuse previously generated story seeds to avoid unnecessary LLM calls

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a backend service, I want to support both simple text descriptions and structured POI data as input, so that I can handle various types of location-based content generation requests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN receiving a simple text description THEN the system SHALL generate narrative content based on the text input
2. WHEN receiving structured POI data THEN the system SHALL generate content using the structured information and metadata
3. WHEN generating content THEN the system SHALL store the original prompt alongside the generated content for analysis
4. WHEN story content is requested by story ID THEN the system SHALL return the generated content with metadata including generation timestamp and source prompts

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the backend to handle external service failures gracefully, so that the system remains operational even when third-party APIs are unavailable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the LLM service is unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate error responses without crashing
2. WHEN POI discovery services fail THEN the system SHALL return meaningful error messages to the client
3. WHEN external APIs are slow THEN the system SHALL implement reasonable timeout handling
4. WHEN the system starts up THEN it SHALL provide health check endpoints to verify service status

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the backend to use modern TypeScript and Deno technologies, so that the codebase is maintainable and follows current best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the backend THEN the system SHALL use Deno as the runtime environment
2. WHEN building the application THEN the system SHALL use the Danet framework for dependency injection and HTTP handling
3. WHEN managing dependencies THEN the system SHALL use JSR (JavaScript Registry) for all external packages
4. WHEN writing code THEN the system SHALL use TypeScript with strict mode enabled
5. WHEN organizing code THEN the system SHALL follow a modular architecture with separate modules for different concerns

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want comprehensive testing coverage for the backend services, so that I can ensure reliability and catch regressions early.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing services THEN each service SHALL have corresponding unit tests using Deno's built-in testing framework
2. WHEN creating API endpoints THEN they SHALL have integration tests that verify request/response handling
3. WHEN testing external integrations THEN the system SHALL use mock services to avoid dependencies on external APIs during testing
4. WHEN running tests THEN they SHALL execute quickly and provide clear feedback on failures

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a mobile app, I want the backend to provide a complete orchestration API, so that I can send location data and receive ready-to-use content segments as text.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sending location data to the orchestration endpoint THEN the system SHALL coordinate POI discovery and content generation
2. WHEN content generation is complete THEN the system SHALL return a story ID and content metadata
3. WHEN requesting a specific story THEN the system SHALL return the complete generated content with duration estimates
4. WHEN the orchestration service is functional THEN this backend MVP phase SHALL be considered complete

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a mobile app, I want the backend to provide story seeds for a given location, so that I can present multiple story options to users and track their listening history.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requesting story seeds for a location THEN the system SHALL return a list of story IDs with their corresponding story titles and summaries
2. WHEN generating story seeds THEN the system SHALL create paragraph-long story summaries that can be expanded into full stories
3. WHEN creating story titles THEN the system SHALL generate titles that create collision potential for interchangeable stories about the same topic
4. WHEN story seeds are generated THEN the system SHALL persist the association between story seeds (natural keys) and story IDs (surrogate keys) in server memory
5. WHEN the same location and context are requested THEN the system SHALL return consistent story seeds to enable proper deduplication

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a mobile app, I want to retrieve full story content using a story ID, so that I can provide complete narratives to users when they select a story to hear.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requesting a story by story ID THEN the system SHALL return the complete narrative content if it has already been generated
2. WHEN requesting a story that hasn't been fully generated THEN the system SHALL generate the full story content using the stored story seed and summary
3. WHEN generating full story content THEN the system SHALL use the story summary as the foundation for expansion into a complete narrative
4. WHEN story generation fails THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate error responses while maintaining the story seed for retry attempts
5. WHEN full story content is generated THEN the system SHALL cache it for future requests using the same story ID
